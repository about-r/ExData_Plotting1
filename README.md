## Exploratory Data Analysis: Course Project 1 

## Overview
The task for this assignment is to reconstruct the following plots below, all of which were constructed using the base plotting system.
For original instractions and details about dataset follow  
  https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1/blob/master/README.md 

## The requirements for the project
  1. Construct the plot and save it to a PNG file with a width of 480 pixels and a height of 480 pixels.
  2. Name each of the plot files as plot1.png, plot2.png, etc.
  3. Create a separate R code file (plot1.R, plot2.R, etc.) that constructs the corresponding plot, i.e. code in plot1.R constructs the plot1.png plot. Your code file should include code for reading the data so that the plot can be fully reproduced. You must also include the code that creates the PNG file.
  4. Add the PNG file and R code file to the top-level folder of your git repository.
  5. Push your git repository to GitHub 

## How to use the code
1. Scripts are to be installed into a working folder, which will be used to download and unzip the original set. 
2. In R `Change dir...` to the working folder and execute scripts one by one, for example
```
  source("plot1.R")
  source("plot2.R")
  source("plot3.R")
  source("plot4.R")
```
3. Review `.png` files created in a browser of your choice.
4. Done
